# VivintRTSP
This covers a detailed guide and sample configurations for deriving the RTSP streams of Vivint security cameras so that they can be used in other NVR solutions such as Frigate. This guide assumes a HomeAssistant supervised installation of Frigate, but it should also work for any third party NVR implementation that relies on RTSP streams like Frigate. It also requires some version HomeAssistant installed and the Vivint custom componets integration set up and configured appropriately (either manually or with HACS). To see how to do this, refer to the YouTube guide here: (Coming Soon)
